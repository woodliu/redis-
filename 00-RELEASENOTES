Redis 6.0 release notes
=======================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade urgency levels:

LOW:      No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH:     There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.
SECURITY: There are security fixes in the release.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
Redis 6.0-rc3     Released Tue Mar 31 17:42:39 CEST 2020
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: A connection management bug introduced with the
                          SSL implementation can crash Redis easily.

Dear users, this is a list of the major changes in this release, please check 
the list of commits for detail:

* Fix crash due to refactoring for SSL, for the connection code.
* Precise timeouts for blocking commands. Now the timeouts have HZ
  resolution regardless of the number of connected clinets. New timeouts
  are stored in a radix tree and sorted by expire time.
* Fix rare crash when resizing the event loop because of CONFIG maxclients.
* Fix systemd readiness after successful partial resync.
* Redis-cli ask password mode to be prompted at startup (for additional safety).
* Keyspace notifications added to MIGRATE / RESTORE.
* Threaded I/O bugs fixed.
* Implement new ACL style AUTH in Sentinel.
* Make 'requirepass' more backward compatible with Redis <= 5.
* ACL: Handle default user as disabled if it's off regardless of "nopass".
* Fix a potential inconsistency when upgrading an instance in Redis Cluster
  and restarting it. The instance will act as a replica but will actually be
  set as a master immediately. However the choice of what to do with already
  expired keys, on loading, was made from the POV of replicas.
* Abort transactions after -READONLY error.
* Many different fixes to module APIs.
* BITFIELD_RO added to call the command on read only replicas.
* PSYNC2: meaningful offset implementation. Allow the disconnected master
  that is still sending PINGs to replicas, to be able to successfully
  PSYNC incrementally to new slaves, discarding the last part of the
  replication backlog consisting only of PINGs.
* Fix pipelined MULTI/EXEC during Lua scripts are in BUSY state.
* Re-fix propagation API in modules, broken again after other changes.

================================================================================
Redis 6.0 RC2     Released Thu Mar 05 15:40:53 CET 2020
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency MODERATE: Normal bugfixing release of a non-GA branch.

Hi Redis users, Redis 6 is approaching and will be released 30th of April.
New release candidates will be released at the end of March, then another
one mid April, to finally reach the GA at the end of April.

Redis 6 RC2 brings many fixes and new things, especially in the area of
client side caching. This is the list of big changes in this release. As
usually you can find the full list of commits at the end:

New features and improvements:

* ACL LOG: log denied commands, keys accesses and authentications.
* Client side caching redesigned. Now we use keys not caching slots.
* Client side caching: Broadcasting mode implemented.
* Client side caching: OPTIN/OPTOUT modes implemented.
* Remove RDB files used for replication in persistence-less instances (option).

Fixes (only selected ones, see commits for all the fixes):

* Different fixes to streams in edge cases.
* Fix duplicated CLIENT SETNAME reply because of RESP3 changes.
* Fix crash due to new active expire division by zero.
* Avoid sentinel changes promoted_slave to be its own replica.
* Fix bug on KEYS command where pattern starts with * followed by \x00.
* Threaded I/O: now the main thread is used as well to do I/O.
* Many fixes to modules APIs, and more to come in the next RCs.
* ld2string should fail if string contains \0 in the middle.
* Make the Redis test more reliable.
* Fix SPOP returning nil (see #4709). WARNING: API change.

================================================================================
Redis 6.0 RC1   Released Thu Dec 19 09:58:24 CEST 2019
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency LOW: This is the first RC of Redis 6.

Introduction to the Redis 6 release
===================================

Redis 6 improves Redis in a number of key areas and is one of the largest
Redis releases in the history of the project, so here we'll list only
the biggest features in this release:

* The modules system now has a number of new APIs that allow module authors
  to make things otherwise not possible in the past. It is possible to
  store arbitrary module private data in RDB files, to hook on different
  server events, capture and rewrite commands executions, block clients on
  keys, and so forth. 
* The Redis active expire cycle was rewritten for much faster eviction of keys
  that are already expired. Now the effort is tunable.
* Redis now supports SSL on all channels.
* ACL support, you can define users that can run only certain commands and/or
  can only access only certain keys patterns.
* Redis now supports a new protocol called RESP3, which returns more
  semantical replies: new clients using this protocol can understand just
  from the reply what type to return to the calling program.
* There is server-side support for client-side caching of key values. This
  feature is still experimental and will get more changes during the next
  release candidates, but you can already test it and read about it here:
  https://redis.io/topics/client-side-caching
* Redis can now optionally use threads to handle I/O, allowing to serve
  2 times as much operations per second in a single instance when
  pipelining cannot be used.
* Diskless replication is now supported even on replicas: a replica is now
  able, under certain conditions the user can configure, to load the RDB
  in the first synchronization directly from the socket to the memory.
* Redis-benchmark now supports a Redis Cluster mode.
* SRANDMEMBER and similar commands have a better distribution.
* Redis-cli improvements.
* Systemd support rewritten.
* A Redis Cluster proxy was released here:
  https://github.com/artix75/redis-cluster-proxy
* A Disque module for Redis was released here:
  https://github.com/antirez/disque-module

Thanks to all the users and developers who made this release possible.
We'll follow up with more RC releases, until the code looks production ready
and we don't get reports of serious issues for a while.

A special thank you for the amount of work put into this release

Migrating from 5.0 to 6.0
=========================

Redis 6.0 is mostly a strict superset of 5.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 5.0 to 6.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 6.0 release:

* The SPOP <count> command no longer returns null when the set key does not
  exist. Now it returns the empty set as it should and as happens when it is
  called with a 0 argument. This is technically a fix, however it changes the
  old behavior.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Credits: For each release, a list of changes with the relative author is
provided. Where not specified the implementation and design is done by
Salvatore Sanfilippo. Thanks to Redis Labs for making all this possible.
Also many thanks to all the other contributors and the amazing community
we have.

Commit messages may contain additional credits.

Enjoy,
Salvatore
